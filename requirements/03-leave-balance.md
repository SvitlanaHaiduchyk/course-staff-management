# Requirement: employees and managers see leave balances, and leave beyond the balance counts as Unpaid leave

### Why

Today the Sick leave and Personal leave balances are counted by hand in a spreadsheet, and absences of a few hours are
counted inconsistently. The employee does not know how many days are left, and the manager approves leave without
seeing that the balance is already used up. With this requirement the portal itself counts used and remaining days
from approved records, consistently for whole days and hours, and warns when a request exceeds the balance.

### Users and roles

- Employee (`employee`) — sees only their own balances; sees a warning when a request exceeds the balance.
- Responsible manager (`manager`) — sees the full balances of employees who have at least one of their positions; sees a warning on the
  record and decides whether to approve it with a split into paid and unpaid parts.
- Administrator (`admin`) — sees the balances of all employees.

### Main scenario

1. For each leave type the employee sees: how many days are granted for the school year, how many were carried over
   from the previous one, how many are used and how many remain (for types without a limit — used only).
2. The employee submits a request; if it exceeds the balance, the employee sees a warning but can still submit.
3. The manager sees a warning on the record and a suggested split: a paid part up to the balance and an unpaid part
   for the rest.
4. The manager approves the record with the split or rejects it.
5. After approval the balance decreases; records with other statuses do not change the balance.

### Acceptance criteria

- AC-BALANCE-01: Given an employee with no approved records in school year 2026–2027 and no carried-over days. When the employee views their balances. Then the employee sees: "Sick leave" — granted 18.00, used 0.00, remaining 18.00; "Personal leave" — granted 18.00, used 0.00, remaining 18.00; "Unpaid leave" and "Family celebration" — used 0.00 only.
- AC-BALANCE-02: Given an employee with a Sick leave balance of 18.00 and a main position with the schedule Tue 08:30–15:30. When the manager approves a "Sick leave" record for the whole day 2026-11-03. Then used is 1.00, remaining 17.00.
- AC-BALANCE-03: Given an employee with a Sick leave balance of 18.00 and a single position with the schedule Tue 08:30–15:30 (7 h). When the manager approves a "Sick leave" record on 2026-11-03 from 09:00 to 11:30 (2 h 30 min). Then used is 0.36 (150 min of 420 min), remaining 17.64.

When the manager approves the 2026-11-03 record and then opens the 2026-11-04 record. Then the manager sees the warning "This request exceeds the Personal leave balance (0.50 day). Suggested: 0.50 day Personal leave, 0.50 day Unpaid leave".
- AC-BALANCE-15: Given an employee whose "Personal leave" shows remaining 0.20 and a single position with the schedule Tue 08:30–15:30 (420 min).

- AC-BALANCE-21: Given an employee with 5.00 days of "Sick leave" left in school year 2026–2027 and a whole-day "Sick leave" record for 2027-08-30 with status "Awaiting decision". When the manager approves it on 2027-09-02. Then "Sick leave" 2026–2027 shows remaining 4.00, and 2027–2028 shows carried over 4.00, remaining 22.00.
- AC-BALANCE-22: Given an employee with a position scheduled on 2027-08-31 and 2027-09-01. When the manager approves both whole-day "Personal leave" records of a request for these two dates. Then "Personal leave" shows used 1.00 more in school year 2026–2027 and used 1.00 more in school year 2027–2028.

### Out of scope

- The administrator changing the number of days per year (18) in settings — slice WS10; in this slice it is 18 days.
- Returning days to the balance after an approved record is cancelled — slice WS11 (together with cancellation).
- Reports with leave hours and substitute minutes — slice WS9.
- Limits on Unpaid leave and Family celebration: they are only counted, not limited.
- Any amounts of money: the portal counts only days and hours.

### Assumptions

- All dates and times are in Kyiv time (Europe/Kyiv).
- The school year runs from 1 September to 31 August of the next calendar year (confirmed by PM).
- "Sick leave" and "Personal leave" — 18.00 days per school year each, separately (confirmed by PM); the limit belongs to the employee,
  not to a position: all of an employee's positions draw from one balance.
- Unused days carry over to the next school year in full, with no cap.
- Share of a day = the record's minutes ÷ all of the employee's working minutes on that date across the schedules
  of all their positions (confirmed by PM). Records that together cover all those minutes count as 1.00 day; a
  whole day of only one of several positions counts as its share (AC-BALANCE-06). One date never counts as more
  than 1.00 day.
- The schedules of one employee's positions never overlap in time, so every working minute of a date belongs to
  exactly one position. Schedules are kept non-overlapping by the administrator (slice WS10); test data is created
  without overlaps.
- The share of a day is calculated for each date separately and rounded half up to 2 decimal places (0.355 → 0.36);
  the balance is the sum of the rounded shares.
- The over-balance warning (AC-BALANCE-08, -15, -17) does not stop the request, so it must be distinguishable from an
  error that does (for example AC-LEAVE-18): the employee can tell "not saved" from "saved, but note this". How
  this looks is the developer's choice; the message text is always exactly as in the AC.
- Only records with status "Approved" reduce the balance.
- A record reduces the balance of the school year its date belongs to, whenever it is approved. A late approval for
  a past school year also lowers the next year's carried-over days. A request over two school years gives records
  in each year.
- A record approved with a split stays one record with its leave type; the split is shown on it and counted in
  the balances of both types.
- A responsible manager of any of the employee's positions sees the employee's full balance, the same numbers the
  employee sees.
- The warning to the employee is one warning for the total of the whole request and uses the balance at the moment
  of submission; the warning and suggested split for
  the manager use the balance at the moment the manager opens and decides the record, after any approvals made
  in between.
- Carried-over days at the start of the first school year for testing are entered by the developer as test data.
