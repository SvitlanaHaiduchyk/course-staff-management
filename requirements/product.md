# Product: school staff leave portal

<!--

### Vision

At the school, staff (teachers, assistants, office staff) ask for leave or for a few hours off verbally or through
spreadsheets. One employee often holds two positions in different divisions (for example, main position — elementary
school teacher, additional position — high school math teacher), and each position is approved by its own manager. As a
result, requests get lost, leave balances are counted by hand, and payroll receives an incomplete list of approved
absences.

The portal lets an employee request leave for a whole day or for specific hours according to their schedule, lets a
manager decide only on the positions they are responsible for, and lets the school count balances precisely and keep a
register of approved leave.

Success indicators:

- An employee requests leave for several dates and both of their positions in one go, without asking a manager
  verbally.
- Each manager sees only the records of their own positions in the "Awaiting decision" list and decides on each record
  separately.
- Sick leave and Personal leave balances are calculated automatically to 0.01 day and match the approved records.
- The register of approved leave is produced without manual copying, separately for each division.

### Users and roles

Users are created by the administrator: no invitation emails are sent. One person can hold several roles at once: a
manager or an administrator is also an employee and submits their own requests.

| Role (identifier) | Who | How the role is granted |
|---|---|---|
| `employee` | Teacher, assistant, office worker: submits own leave requests, sees own schedule and balances | every employee created by the administrator has this role |
| `manager` | Responsible manager of one or more positions (for example, the elementary school manager); decides on the records of those positions | only the administrator: assigns a person as manager of specific positions |
| `admin` | School administrator: manages employees, positions, schedules, managers and the school calendar; can decide on any record | only another administrator; cannot change their own role |

### Slice roadmap

| Session | Slice (what the user will be able to do) | Requirements | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| WS6 | An employee requests leave according to their schedule, a manager decides on each record, and the employee sees their balance | `01-leave-request.md`, `02-leave-decision.md`, `03-leave-balance.md` | in progress |
| WS7 | The administrator closes days and hours in the school calendar (holidays, early dismissals), and they cannot be taken as leave | — | planned |
| WS8 | An employee chooses a substitute for each record, and an assistant can temporarily replace a teacher with an upgrade | — | planned |
| WS9 | The administrator views and downloads the register of approved leave separately for each division | — | planned |
| WS10 | The administrator manages employees, positions, schedules, managers and deputy managers | — | planned |
| WS11 | A manager submits a request on behalf of an employee and edits a record's date, hours, leave type or substitute before deciding, and an employee gets a reminder about long Personal leave and cancels an approved record through the manager | — | planned |

### Out of scope

- Emails to users: developers' free mail plan allows only 2 emails per hour and only to members of their project.
  Reminders are an in-app marker; an "invitation" is a link from the administrator.
- Scheduled actions more often than once a day.
- Salaries, pay rates and payroll calculation: the portal neither stores nor shows them; payroll keeps them
  separately.
- Approving a record from an email or a message: decisions are made only in the portal.
- Mobile layout: the portal is designed for a computer.
- Migrating historical leave records from the previous system.
- A voice assistant for submitting requests.
- Verifying that the employee actually spoke with the administrator before long Personal leave: reminder only.
